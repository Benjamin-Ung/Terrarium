Creating a website that pulls images from the subreddit r/EarthPorn and showcases the location on a minimap. 

Tech Stack:
- React for frontend display
- Java/Springboot for bankend?
- AWS for online hosting

Things to work on:
- How to pull information from a reddit post?

- Need to learn React and create basic website

Nice to have features:
- updating display at intervals
- minimap of location display and link to reddit post
- queue of next displays to create seamless transitions
